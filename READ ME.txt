Things I can add to game:
[x] double jump
[ ] expand the level
[ ] add sounds when injured
[ ] add health count and enemies deal damage instead of kill
[ ] add traps that can turn on or off
[ ] add a main menu
[ ] add power ups (like make double jump a power up you collect)
[ ] turn game manager into auto-load like the audio track, so it can be used to change scenes (different levels)
[ ] coyote time (a brief period of time after running off a platform where the game will still register the player pressing the jump button. This means that players don’t have to be absolutely perfect to complete a jump – there’s a small amount of wiggle room.)
